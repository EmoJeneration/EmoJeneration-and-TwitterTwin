@WilliamShatner,2022-09-12T00:37:21Z,,i’m sure it is. he’s been boasting on tumblr that he’s been blackmailing me & another actor. it’s the first i’ve heard about it. 🤷🏼🤣he also claims he’s the co-writer of @winchestersoncw. how a tv writer would be on tumblr putting down actors and keeping a job seems odd to me.🤨 ,5
